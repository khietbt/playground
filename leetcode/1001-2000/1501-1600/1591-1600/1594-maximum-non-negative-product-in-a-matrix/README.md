# [1594. Maximum Non Negative Product in a Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-non-negative-product-in-a-matrix)

You are given `m x n` matrix `grid`. Initially, you are located at the top-left
corner `(0, 0)`, and in each step, you can only **move right or down** in the
matrix.

Among all possible paths starting from the top-left corner `(0, 0)` and ending
in the bottom-right corner `(m - 1, n - 1)`, find the path with the **maximum
non-negative product**. The product of a path is the product of all integers in
the grid cells visited along the path.

Return the _maximum non-negative **modulo** `10$^9$ + 7`. If the maximum product
is **negative**, return `-1`_.

Notice that the modulo is performed after getting the maximum product.

**Example 1:**

![1594-1](./1594-1.jpg)

> **Input:**
>
> - `grid = [[-1, -2, -3], [-2, -3, -3], [-3, -3, -2]]`
>
> **Output:** -1
>
> **Explanation:** It is not possible to get non-negative product in the path
> from (0, 0) to (2, 2), so return -1.

**Example 2:**

![1594-2](./1594-22jpg)

> **Input:**
>
> - `grid = [[1, -2, 1], [1, -2, 1], [3, -4, 1]`
>
> **Output:** 8
>
> **Explanation:** Maximum non-negative product is shown 1 x 1 x -2 x -4 x 1 = 8.

**Example 3:**

![1594-3](./1594-3.jpg)

> **Input:**
>
> - `grid = [[1, 3], [0, -4]]`
>
> **Output:** 0
>
> **Explanation:** Maximum non-negative product is shown: 1 x 0 x -4 = 0.

**Constraints:**

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[0].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 15`
- `-4 <= grid[i][j] <= 4`
