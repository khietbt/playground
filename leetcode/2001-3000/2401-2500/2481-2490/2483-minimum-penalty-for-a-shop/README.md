# [2483. Minimum Penalty for a Shop](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-penalty-for-a-shop)

You are given the customer visit log of a shop represented by a **0-indexed**
string `customers` consisting only of characters `'N'` and `'Y'`:

- If the `i$^th$` character is `'Y'`, it means that customers come at the
  `i$^th$` hour.
- whereas `'N'` indicates that no customers come at the `i$^th$` hour.

If the shop closes at thee `j$^th$` hour (`0 <= j <= n`), the **penalty** is
calculated as follows:

- For every hour when the shop is open and no customers come, the penalty
  increases by `1`.
- For every hour when the shop is closed and customers come, the penalty
  increases by `1`.

Return _the **earliest** hour which the shop must be closed to incur a
**minimum** penalty_.

**Note** that if a shop closes at the `j$^th$` hour, it means the shop is closed
at the hour `j`.

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** customers = "YYNY"
>
> **Output:** 2
>
> **Explanation:**
>
> - Closing the shop at the 0$^th$ hour incurs in 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 3 penalty.
> - Closing the shop at the 1$^st$ hour incurs in 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 2 penalty.
> - Closing the shop at the 2$^nd$ hour incurs in 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 penalty.
> - Closing the shop at the 3$^rd$ hour incurs in 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 2 penalty.
> - Closing the shop at the 4$^th$ hour incurs in 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 1 penalty.
>
> Closing the shop at 2$^nd$ or 4$^th$ hour gives a minimum penalty. Since 2 is
> earlier, the optimal time is 2.

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** customers = "NNNNN"
>
> **Output:** 0
>
> **Explanation:** It is best to close the shop at the 0$^th$ hour as no
> customers arrive.

**Example 3:**

> **Input:** customers = "YYYY"
>
> **Output:** 4
>
> **Explanation:** It is best to close the shop at the 4$^th$ as customers
> arrive each hour.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= customers.length <= 10$^5$`
- `customers` consists only of characters `'Y'` and `'N'`.
